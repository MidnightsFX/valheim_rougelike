  **0.11.1**
---
```
- Deep North update!
```

  **0.11.0**
---
```
In-game editor
- New "Mod Config" button at the bottom right of the main menu and the pause menu opens a death choice
  editor: allows complete configuration of death levels
- Only shown to the host or a server admin. A server admin playing on a dedicated server can edit and
  send changes to the server, which checks them before accepting and then pushes them to everyone.

Configuration
- DeathChoices.yaml is now written with full documentation of every setting at the top of the file.
- New 'Fallback: true' setting marks which level players move to when their choice disappears.
  Previously this was whichever level happened to be first in the file, so reordering changed it.

Fixes
- Fixed a crash on every harvest if one level listed the same prefab in two ResourceModifiers
  entries, and the same crash on kills for duplicate DeathLootModifiers prefabs.
- 'bonusModifer' is now spelled 'BonusModifier'. The old spelling is still read, so existing files
  keep working, but files written by this version use the corrected name.
